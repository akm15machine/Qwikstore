# Introduction
This is a simple API that allows you to create certain properties (in form of API Keys) under which you can create unlimited variables (aka entities) that can be fetched or updated via GET, PUT, POST methods from anywhere. The api is currently hosted at [Heroku](https://https://qwikstore.herokuapp.com/) that can be used as your public endpoint if you don't want to deploy your own instance. The followin section shows the available endpoints and the respective requests and responses. You can find below how to deploy your own instance in section 2.
